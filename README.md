# C-Sharp-Projects
These are some of my projects I have been working on with C# through the use of Visual Studio.

Blackjack
A basic console application that allows a user to play the game Blackjack. Through the use of methods I was able to create a dealer, deck, and shuffled cards as well as implement logic to create the game rules associated with black jack.

Car Insurance
This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user's input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.

NewsLetter MVC
This is an MVC web application that creates a database for a mailing list. It collect's the user's name and contact information, then stores it in a table. It includes an admin page with functionality to view and/or remove the user from the mailing list.
